# lovepages

Lovepages is a "private" social media website where you can create digital scrapbooks of images and text and share them with close friends and romantic partners. The UI of Lovepages is minimal to minimize distractions and allow for personal customization from the end user. My vision for Lovepages is a private online space where you can store and cherish memories with people you know and care about with zero distractions and unlimited customization.
